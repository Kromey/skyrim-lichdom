Description
===========
Death. For most, it is the end. For you, it is the gateway to unimaginable power...

Location
========
5 parts of a journal are scattered randomly about Skyrim. Inside a chest behind Urag gro-Shub's desk in the Winterhold College's Arcanaeum is a mysterious note revealing the locations of all 5 parts.

Details
=======
The secrets to becoming a lich have long been carefully guarded, and even the most learned scholars have been unable to uncover them. All except for Artun, an ancient necromancer not heard from in centuries. Now, his journal has resurfaced, and rumor has it that he wrote down the secrets within its scattered pages. Find them all, put them back together, and you, too, might learn the secrets.

As a lich, you will gain:
[TODO: List benefits and penalties]

Even death is of little concern to you, as your phylactery guards against it by regenerating your body. It is not perfect, however, and you will find yourself severely weakened until you repair it.

Install
=======
1. Extract the files to a temporary location.
2. Copy files to (install folder)\Skyrim\Data\
3. Start Skyrim Launcher, click 'Data Files', place a checkmark beside the .esp file.

Uninstall
=========
1. Start Oblivion Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file.
2. Delete the .esp and .bsa files associated with the mod.

Upgrade
=======
Simply replace the previous .esp and .bsa files with the new ones.

Incompatibility
===============
This mod should be compatible with all others, as it only adds new items. The only risk is if another mod puts something in the exact same place as the chest in the Arcanaeum.

Known Issues or Bugs
====================
* Dying while in Apocrypha transforms a lich into a nether lich, when it should not.
